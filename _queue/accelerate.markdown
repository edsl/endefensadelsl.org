#ACCELERATE
MANIFESTO FOR AN ACCELERATIONIST POLITICS
01. INTRODUCTION: On the Conjuncture
1. At the beginning of the second decade of the Twenty-First Century, global civilization faces
a new breed of cataclysm. These coming apocalypses ridicule the norms and organisational
structures of the politics which were forged in the birth of the nation-state, the rise of
capitalism, and a Twentieth Century of unprecedented wars.
2. Most significant is the breakdown of the planetary climatic system. In time, this threatens
the continued existence of the present global human population. Though this is the most
critical of the threats which face humanity, a series of lesser but potentially equally
destabilising problems exist alongside and intersect with it. Terminal resource depletion,
especially in water and energy reserves, offers the prospect of mass starvation, collapsing
economic paradigms, and new hot and cold wars. Continued financial crisis has led
governments to embrace the paralyzing death spiral policies of austerity, privatisation of
social welfare services, mass unemployment, and stagnating wages. Increasing automation in
production processes – including ‘intellectual labour’ – is evidence of the secular crisis of
capitalism, soon to render it incapable of maintaining current standards of living for even the
former middle classes of the global north.
3. In contrast to these ever-accelerating catastrophes, today’s politics is beset by an inability
to generate the new ideas and modes of organisation necessary to transform our societies to
confront and resolve the coming annihilations. While crisis gathers force and speed, politics
withers and retreats. In this paralysis of the political imaginary, the future has been cancelled.
4. Since 1979, the hegemonic global political ideology has been neoliberalism, found in some
variant throughout the leading economic powers. In spite of the deep structural challenges the
new global problems present to it, most immediately the credit, financial, and fiscal crises
since 2007-8, neoliberal programmes have only evolved in the sense of deepening. This
continuation of the neoliberal project, or neoliberalism 2.0, has begun to apply another round
of structural adjustments, most significantly in the form of encouraging new and aggressive
incursions by the private sector into what remains of social democratic institutions and
services. This is in spite of the immediately negative economic and social effects of such
policies, and the longer term fundamental barriers posed by the new global crises.
5. That the forces of right wing governmental, non-governmental, and corporate power have
been able to press forth with neoliberalisation is at least in part a result of the continued
paralysis and ineffectual nature of much what remains of the left. Thirty years of neoliberalism
have rendered most left-leaning political parties bereft of radical thought, hollowed out, and
without a popular mandate. At best they have responded to our present crises with calls for a
return to a Keynesian economics, in spite of the evidence that the very conditions which
enabled post-war social democracy to occur no longer exist. We cannot return to mass
industrial-Fordist labour by fiat, if at all. Even the neosocialist regimes of South America’s
Bolivarian Revolution, whilst heartening in their ability to resist the dogmas of contemporary
capitalism, remain disappointingly unable to advance an alternative beyond mid-Twentieth
Century socialism. Organised labour, being systematically weakened by the changes wrought
in the neoliberal project, is sclerotic at an institutional level and – at best – capable only of
mildly mitigating the new structural adjustments. But with no systematic approach to building
a new economy, or the structural solidarity to push such changes through, for now labour
remains relatively impotent. The new social movements which emerged since the end of the
Cold War, experiencing a resurgence in the years after 2008, have been similarly unable to
devise a new political ideological vision. Instead they expend considerable energy on internal
direct-democratic process and affective self-valorisation over strategic efficacy, and frequently
propound a variant of neo-primitivist localism, as if to if to oppose the abstract violence of
globalised capital with the flimsy and ephemeral “authenticity” of communal immediacy.

6. In the absence of a radically new social, political, organisational, and economic vision the
hegemonic powers of the right will continue to be able to push forward their narrow-minded
imaginary, in the face of any and all evidence. At best, the left may be able for a time to
partially resist some of the worst incursions. But this is to be Canute against an ultimately
irresistible tide. To generate a new left global hegemony entails a recovery of lost possible
futures, and indeed the recovery of the future as such.

02. INTEREGNUM: On Accelerationisms
1. If any system has been associated with ideas of acceleration it is capitalism. The essential
metabolism of capitalism demands economic growth, with competition between individual
capitalist entities setting in motion increasing technological developments in an attempt to
achieve competitive advantage, all accompanied by increasing social dislocation. In its
neoliberal form, its ideological self-presentation is one of liberating the forces of creative
destruction, setting free ever-accelerating technological and social innovations.
2. The philosopher Nick Land captured this most acutely, with a myopic yet hypnotising belief
that capitalist speed alone could generate a global transition towards unparalleled
technological singularity. In this visioning of capital, the human can eventually be discarded as
mere drag to an abstract planetary intelligence rapidly constructing itself from the bricolaged
fragments of former civilisations. However Landian neoliberalism confuses speed with
acceleration. We may be moving fast, but only within a strictly defined set of capitalist
parameters that themselves never waver. We experience only the increasing speed of a local
horizon, a simple brain-dead onrush rather than an acceleration which is also navigational, an
experimental process of discovery within a universal space of possibility. It is the latter mode
of acceleration which we hold as essential.
3. Even worse, as Deleuze and Guattari recognized, from the very beginning what capitalist
speed deterritorializes with one hand, it reterritorializes with the other. Progress becomes
constrained within a framework of surplus value, a reserve army of labour, and free-floating
capital. Modernity is reduced to statistical measures of economic growth and social innovation
becomes encrusted with kitsch remainders from our communal past. Thatcherite-Reaganite
deregulation sits comfortably alongside Victorian ‘back-to-basics’ family and religious values.
4. A deeper tension within neoliberalism is in terms of its self-image as the vehicle of
modernity, as literally synonymous with modernisation, whilst promising a future that it is
constitutively incapable of providing. Indeed, as neoliberalism has progressed, rather than
enabling individual creativity, it has tended towards eliminating cognitive inventiveness in
favour of an affective production line of scripted interactions, coupled to global supply chains
and a neo-Fordist Eastern production zone. A vanishingly small cognitariat of elite intellectual
workers shrinks with each passing year – and increasingly so as algorithmic automation
winds its way through the spheres of affective and intellectual labour. Neoliberalism, though
positing itself as a necessary historical development, was in fact a merely contingent means
to ward off the crisis of value that emerged in the 1970s. Inevitably this was a sublimation of
the crisis rather than its ultimate overcoming.
5. It is Marx, along with Land, who remains the paradigmatic accelerationist thinker. Contrary
to the all-too familiar critique, and even the behaviour of some contemporary Marxians, we
must remember that Marx himself used the most advanced theoretical tools and empirical
data available in an attempt to fully understand and transform his world. He was not a thinker
who resisted modernity, but rather one who sought to analyse and intervene within it,
understanding that for all its exploitation and corruption, capitalism remained the most
advanced economic system to date. Its gains were not to be reversed, but accelerated
beyond the constraints the capitalist value form.
6. Indeed, as even Lenin wrote in the 1918 text “Left Wing” Childishness:
"Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the
latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable without planned state

organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a
unified standard in production and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of
this, and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not
understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left SocialistRevolutionaries)."
7. As Marx was aware, capitalism cannot be identified as the agent of true acceleration.
Similarly, the assessment of left politics as antithetical to technosocial acceleration is also, at
least in part, a severe misrepresentation. Indeed, if the political left is to have a future it must
be one in which it maximally embraces this suppressed accelerationist tendency.

03: MANIFEST: On the Future
1. We believe the most important division in today’s left is between those that hold to a folk
politics of localism, direct action, and relentless horizontalism, and those that outline what
must become called an accelerationist politics at ease with a modernity of abstraction,
complexity, globality, and technology. The former remains content with establishing small and
temporary spaces of non-capitalist social relations, eschewing the real problems entailed in
facing foes which are intrinsically non-local, abstract, and rooted deep in our everyday
infrastructure. The failure of such politics has been built-in from the very beginning. By
contrast, an accelerationist politics seeks to preserve the gains of late capitalism while going
further than its value system, governance structures, and mass pathologies will allow.
2. All of us want to work less. It is an intriguing question as to why it was that the world’s
leading economist of the post-war era believed that an enlightened capitalism inevitably
progressed towards a radical reduction of working hours. In The Economic Prospects for Our
Grandchildren (written in 1930), Keynes forecast a capitalist future where individuals would
have their work reduced to three hours a day. What has instead occurred is the progressive
elimination of the work-life distinction, with work coming to permeate every aspect of the
emerging social factory.
3. Capitalism has begun to constrain the productive forces of technology, or at least, direct
them towards needlessly narrow ends. Patent wars and idea monopolisation are
contemporary phenomena that point to both capital’s need to move beyond competition, and
capital’s increasingly retrograde approach to technology. The properly accelerative gains of
neoliberalism have not led to less work or less stress. And rather than a world of space travel,
future shock, and revolutionary technological potential, we exist in a time where the only thing
which develops is marginally better consumer gadgetry. Relentless iterations of the same
basic product sustain marginal consumer demand at the expense of human acceleration.
4. We do not want to return to Fordism. There can be no return to Fordism. The capitalist
“golden era” was premised on the production paradigm of the orderly factory environment,
where (male) workers received security and a basic standard of living in return for a lifetime of
stultifying boredom and social repression. Such a system relied upon an international
hierarchy of colonies, empires, and an underdeveloped periphery; a national hierarchy of
racism and sexism; and a rigid family hierarchy of female subjugation. For all the nostalgia
many may feel, this regime is both undesirable and practically impossible to return to.
5. Accelerationists want to unleash latent productive forces. In this project, the material
platform of neoliberalism does not need to be destroyed. It needs to be repurposed towards
common ends. The existing infrastructure is not a capitalist stage to be smashed, but a
springboard to launch towards post-capitalism.
6. Given the enslavement of technoscience to capitalist objectives (especially since the late
1970s) we surely do not yet know what a modern technosocial body can do. Who amongst us
fully recognizes what untapped potentials await in the technology which has already been
developed? Our wager is that the true transformative potentials of much of our technological
and scientific research remain unexploited, filled with presently redundant features (or pre-

adaptations) that, following a shift beyond the short-sighted capitalist socius, can become
decisive.
7. We want to accelerate the process of technological evolution. But what we are arguing for
is not techno-utopianism. Never believe that technology will be sufficient to save us.
Necessary, yes, but never sufficient without socio-political action. Technology and the social
are intimately bound up with one another, and changes in either potentiate and reinforce
changes in the other. Whereas the techno-utopians argue for acceleration on the basis that it
will automatically overcome social conflict, our position is that technology should be
accelerated precisely because it is needed in order to win social conflicts.
8. We believe that any post-capitalism will require post-capitalist planning. The faith placed in
the idea that, after a revolution, the people will spontaneously constitute a novel
socioeconomic system that isn’t simply a return to capitalism is naïve at best, and ignorant at
worst. To further this, we must develop both a cognitive map of the existing system and a
speculative image of the future economic system.
9. To do so, the left must take advantage of every technological and scientific advance made
possible by capitalist society. We declare that quantification is not an evil to be eliminated, but
a tool to be used in the most effective manner possible. Economic modelling is – simply put –
a necessity for making intelligible a complex world. The 2008 financial crisis reveals the risks
of blindly accepting mathematical models on faith, yet this is a problem of illegitimate authority
not of mathematics itself. The tools to be found in social network analysis, agent-based
modelling, big data analytics, and non-equilibrium economic models, are necessary cognitive
mediators for understanding complex systems like the modern economy. The accelerationist
left must become literate in these technical fields.
10. Any transformation of society must involve economic and social experimentation. The
Chilean Project Cybersyn is emblematic of this experimental attitude – fusing advanced
cybernetic technologies, with sophisticated economic modelling, and a democratic platform
instantiated in the technological infrastructure itself. Similar experiments were conducted in
1950s-1960s Soviet economics as well, employing cybernetics and linear programming in an
attempt to overcome the new problems faced by the first communist economy. That both of
these were ultimately unsuccessful can be traced to the political and technological constraints
these early cyberneticians operated under.
11. The left must develop sociotechnical hegemony: both in the sphere of ideas, and in the
sphere of material platforms. Platforms are the infrastructure of global society. They establish
the basic parameters of what is possible, both behaviourally and ideologically. In this sense,
they embody the material transcendental of society: they are what make possible particular
sets of actions, relationships, and powers. While much of the current global platform is biased
towards capitalist social relations, this is not an inevitable necessity. These material platforms
of production, finance, logistics, and consumption can and will be reprogrammed and
reformatted towards post-capitalist ends.
12. We do not believe that direct action is sufficient to achieve any of this. The habitual tactics
of marching, holding signs, and establishing temporary autonomous zones risk becoming
comforting substitutes for effective success. “At least we have done something” is the rallying
cry of those who privilege self-esteem rather than effective action. The only criterion of a good
tactic is whether it enables significant success or not. We must be done with fetishising
particular modes of action. Politics must be treated as a set of dynamic systems, riven with
conflict, adaptations and counter-adaptations, and strategic arms races. This means that each
individual type of political action becomes blunted and ineffective over time as the other sides
adapt. No given mode of political action is historically inviolable. Indeed, over time, there is an
increasing need to discard familiar tactics as the forces and entities they are marshalled
against learn to defend and counter-attack them effectively. It is in part the contemporary left’s
inability to do so which lies close to the heart of the contemporary malaise.
13. The overwhelming privileging of democracy-as-process needs to be left behind. The
fetishisation of openness, horizontality, and inclusion of much of today’s ‘radical’ left set the

stage for ineffectiveness. Secrecy, verticality, and exclusion all have their place as well in
effective political action (though not, of course, an exclusive one).
14. Democracy cannot be defined simply by its means – not via voting, discussion, or general
assemblies. Real democracy must be defined by its goal – collective self-mastery. This is a
project which must align politics with the legacy of the Enlightenment, to the extent that it is
only through harnessing our ability to understand ourselves and our world better (our social,
technical, economic, psychological world) that we can come to rule ourselves. We need to
posit a collectively controlled legitimate vertical authority in addition to distributed horizontal
forms of sociality, to avoid becoming the slaves of either a tyrannical totalitarian centralism or
a capricious emergent order beyond our control. The command of The Plan must be married
to the improvised order of The Network.
15. We do not present any particular organisation as the ideal means to embody these
vectors. What is needed – what has always been needed – is an ecology of organisations, a
pluralism of forces, resonating and feeding back on their comparative strengths. Sectarianism
is the death knell of the left as much as centralization is, and in this regard we continue to
welcome experimentation with different tactics (even those we disagree with).
16. We have three medium term concrete goals. First, we need to build an intellectual
infrastructure. Mimicking the Mont Pelerin Society of the neoliberal revolution, this is to be
tasked with creating a new ideology, economic and social models, and a vision of the good to
replace and surpass the emaciated ideals that rule our world today. This is an infrastructure in
the sense of requiring the construction not just of ideas, but institutions and material paths to
inculcate, embody and spread them.
17. We need to construct wide-scale media reform. In spite of the seeming democratisation
offered by the internet and social media, traditional media outlets remain crucial in the
selection and framing of narratives, along with possessing the funds to prosecute
investigative journalism. Bringing these bodies as close as possible to popular control is
crucial to undoing the current presentation of the state of things.
18. Finally, we need to reconstitute various forms of class power. Such a reconstitution must
move beyond the notion that an organically generated global proletariat already exists.
Instead it must seek to knit together a disparate array of partial proletarian identities, often
embodied in post-Fordist forms of precarious labour.
19. Groups and individuals are already at work on each of these, but each is on their own
insufficient. What is required is all three feeding back into one another, with each modifying
the contemporary conjunction in such a way that the others become more and more effective.
A positive feedback loop of infrastructural, ideological, social and economic transformation,
generating a new complex hegemony, a new post-capitalist technosocial platform. History
demonstrates it has always been a broad assemblage of tactics and organisations which has
brought about systematic change; these lessons must be learned.
20. To achieve each of these goals, on the most practical level we hold that the accelerationist
left must think more seriously about the flows of resources and money required to build an
effective new political infrastructure. Beyond the ‘people power’ of bodies in the street, we
require funding, whether from governments, institutions, think tanks, unions, or individual
benefactors. We consider the location and conduction of such funding flows essential to begin
reconstructing an ecology of effective accelerationist left organizations.
21. We declare that only a Promethean politics of maximal mastery over society and its
environment is capable of either dealing with global problems or achieving victory over
capital. This mastery must be distinguished from that beloved of thinkers of the original
Enlightenment. The clockwork universe of Laplace, so easily mastered given sufficient
information, is long gone from the agenda of serious scientific understanding. But this is not to
align ourselves with the tired residue of postmodernity, decrying mastery as proto-fascistic or
authority as innately illegitimate. Instead we propose that the problems besetting our planet
and our species oblige us to refurbish mastery in a newly complex guise; whilst we cannot

predict the precise result of our actions, we can determine probabilistically likely ranges of
outcomes. What must be coupled to such complex systems analysis is a new form of action:
improvisatory and capable of executing a design through a practice which works with the
contingencies it discovers only in the course of its acting, in a politics of geosocial artistry and
cunning rationality. A form of abductive experimentation that seeks the best means to act in a
complex world.
22. We need to revive the argument that was traditionally made for post-capitalism: not only is
capitalism an unjust and perverted system, but it is also a system that holds back progress.
Our technological development is being suppressed by capitalism, as much as it has been
unleashed. Accelerationism is the basic belief that these capacities can and should be let
loose by moving beyond the limitations imposed by capitalist society. The movement towards
a surpassing of our current constraints must include more than simply a struggle for a more
rational global society. We believe it must also include recovering the dreams which transfixed
many from the middle of the Nineteenth Century until the dawn of the neoliberal era, of the
quest of Homo Sapiens towards expansion beyond the limitations of the earth and our
immediate bodily forms. These visions are today viewed as relics of a more innocent moment.
Yet they both diagnose the staggering lack of imagination in our own time, and offer the
promise of a future that is affectively invigorating, as well as intellectually energising. After all,
it is only a post-capitalist society, made possible by an accelerationist politics, which will ever
be capable of delivering on the promissory note of the mid-Twentieth Century’s space
programmes, to shift beyond a world of minimal technical upgrades towards all-encompassing
change. Towards a time of collective self-mastery, and the properly alien future that entails
and enables. Towards a completion of the Enlightenment project of self-criticism and selfmastery, rather than its elimination.
23. The choice facing us is severe: either a globalised post-capitalism or a slow fragmentation
towards primitivism, perpetual crisis, and planetary ecological collapse.
24. The future needs to be constructed. It has been demolished by neoliberal capitalism and
reduced to a cut-price promise of greater inequality, conflict, and chaos. This collapse in the
idea of the future is symptomatic of the regressive historical status of our age, rather than, as
cynics across the political spectrum would have us believe, a sign of sceptical maturity. What
accelerationism pushes towards is a future that is more modern – an alternative modernity
that neoliberalism is inherently unable to generate. The future must be cracked open once
again, unfastening our horizons towards the universal possibilities of the Outside.
